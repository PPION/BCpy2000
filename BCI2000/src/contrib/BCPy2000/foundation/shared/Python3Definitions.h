       Compact strings use only one memory block (structure + characters),
       whereas legacy strings use one block for the structure and one block
       for characters.

       Legacy strings are created by PyUnicode_FromUnicode() and
       PyUnicode_FromStringAndSize(NULL, size) functions. They become ready
       when PyUnicode_READY() is called.
